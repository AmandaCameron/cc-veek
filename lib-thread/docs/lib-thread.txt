_lib-thread_ is a _lib-kidven_ based thread pool system. while it can not provide forced multitasking, it does make coroutines much prettier than the parallel API allows.


Thread Object
-------------

  * *Constructor*
    * kidven.new('thread-pool')
  * *Methods*
    * :new(func, handler) -- Adds a new thread, running func, with the given handler.
    * :stop() -- Stops the thread pool.
    * :main() -- Runs the thread pool *This blocks until the threads are all finished, or :stop() is called*

Handlers
--------

Threads may be given a special handler table, that is providing various callbacks to the running app. The following callbacks are available.

  * :created() -- Called after :new(), when the thread is initalised into the loop.
  * :error(err) -- Called when the thread errors.
  * :die() -- Called when the thread ends.
